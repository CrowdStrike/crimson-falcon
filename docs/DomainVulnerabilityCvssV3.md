## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **attack_complexity** | **String** | Describes the conditions beyond the attackerâ€™s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability, one of: Low, High | [optional] |
| **attack_vector** | **String** | Reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible, one of: Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical | [optional] |
| **availability_impact** | **String** | Measures the potential impact to availability of a successfully exploited misuse vulnerability, one of: None, Low, High | [optional] |
| **confidentiality_impact** | **String** | Measures the potential impact on confidentiality of a successfully exploited misuse vulnerability, one of: None, Low, High | [optional] |
| **integrity_impact** | **String** | Measures the potential impact to integrity of a successfully exploited misuse vulnerability, one of: None, Low, High | [optional] |
| **privileges_required** | **String** | Describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability, one of: None, Low, High | [optional] |
| **scope** | **String** | The Scope metric captures whether a vulnerability in one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope, one of: Unchanged, Changed | [optional] |
| **score** | **Float** | Score of the vulnerability - which is between 0 and 10, the higher is the score - the more riskier the vulnerability is | [optional] |
| **severity** | **String** | Severity of the vulnerability, can be empty or one of: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL | [optional] |
| **user_interaction** | **String** | Captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component, one of: None, Required | [optional] |
