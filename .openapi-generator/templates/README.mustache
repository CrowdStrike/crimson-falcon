# Crimson Falcon - The CrowdStrike Falcon SDK for Ruby

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/crimson-falcon.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/crimson-falcon)

Welcome to Crimson Falcon, the Ruby SDK for the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform. This is where the power of the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform meets the elegance and simplicity of Ruby.

"Why Ruby?" you might ask.

Well, Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. It's unique balance of simplicity, productivity, and just sheer fun, makes coding feel less like a task and more like a hobby. It's like your favorite pair of comfy shoes - familiar, comfortable, and always reliable. :wink:

That's what we aim to achieve with Crimson Falcon - a tool that brings together the robust capabilities of CrowdStrike Falcon with the friendly charm of Ruby.

Ready to bring some fun to your cybersecurity game with Ruby and Crimson Falcon? Let's jump right in!

## Installation

### From RubyGems (*This is the way*)

To install from RubyGems, use the following command:

```shell
gem install {{{gemName}}}
```

Add this to the Gemfile:
<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```ruby
    gem '{{{gemName}}}', '~> {{{gemVersion}}}'
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->
### From Source to Gem: Building the Ruby Code

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build {{{gemName}}}.gemspec
```

Then install the gem locally:
<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```shell
gem install ./{{{gemName}}}-{{{gemVersion}}}.gem
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->
Finally, add this to the Gemfile:
<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```ruby
    gem '{{{gemName}}}', '~> {{{gemVersion}}}'
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->
### Install from Git

If the Ruby gem is hosted at a git repository: <https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}{{^gitUserId}}YOUR_GIT_USERNAME{{/gitUserId}}/{{gitRepoId}}{{^gitRepoId}}YOUR_GIT_REPO{{/gitRepoId}}>, then add the following in the Gemfile:

```ruby
    # Example
    gem 'crimson-falcon', :git => 'https://github.com/CrowdStrike/crimson-falcon.git'
```

## Getting Started

### Samples

We have a collection of sample code that demonstrates how to use the Crimson Falcon SDK.
These samples are a great way to get started with the SDK. You can find the samples in the [samples](./samples) directory.

### Take Flight

Eager to take flight? Follow the [installation](#installation) process, and then launch into the following code:

```ruby
# Load the gem
require '{{{gemName}}}'

# Setup authorization
Falcon.configure do |config|
  config.client_id = ENV["FALCON_CLIENT_ID"]
  config.client_secret = ENV["FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET"]
  config.cloud = "us-2" # or "us-2", "eu-1", "us-gov1"
end

# Create a new API instance
api_instance = Falcon::SensorDownloadApi.new

begin
  # Get CCID to use with sensor installers
  result = api_instance.get_sensor_installers_ccidby_query
  p result.resources
rescue Falcon::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling SensorDownloadApi->get_sensor_installers_ccidby_query: #{e}"
end
```

Welcome aboard the Crimson Falcon! Fly high, code with grace.
