  # unit tests for perform_action_v2
  # Take various actions on the hosts in your environment. Contain or lift containment on a host. Delete or restore a host.

After the host is deleted, no new detections for that host will be reported via UI or APIs - &#x60;unhide_host&#x60;: This action will restore a host. Detection reporting will resume after the host is restored
  # @param body The host agent ID (AID) of the host you want to contain. Get an agent ID from a detection, the Falcon console, or the Streaming API.  Provide the ID in JSON format with the key &#x60;ids&#x60; and the value in square brackets, such as:   &#x60;\&quot;ids\&quot;: [\&quot;123456789\&quot;]&#x60;
