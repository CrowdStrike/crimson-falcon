  # Returns one or more change IDs
  # Returns a list of Falcon FileVantage change IDs filtered, sorted and limited by the query parameters provided
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :offset The first change index to return in the response. If not provided it will default to &#39;0&#39;. Use with the &#x60;limit&#x60; parameter to manage pagination of results.
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit The maximum number of changes to return in the response (default: 100; max: 500). Use with the &#x60;offset&#x60; parameter to manage pagination of results
  # @option opts [String] :sort Sort changes using options like:  - &#x60;action_timestamp&#x60; (timestamp of the change occurrence)    Sort either &#x60;asc&#x60; (ascending) or &#x60;desc&#x60; (descending). For example: &#x60;action_timestamp|asc&#x60;. The full list of allowed sorting options can be reviewed in our API documentation.
  # @option opts [String] :filter Filter changes using a query in Falcon Query Language (FQL).   Common filter options include:   - &#x60;host.host_name&#x60;  - &#x60;action_timestamp&#x60;   The full list of allowed filter parameters can be reviewed in our API documentation.
