  # unit tests for get_combined_assessments_query
  # Search for assessments in your environment by providing an FQL filter and paging details. Returns a set of HostFinding entities which match the filter criteria
  # @param filter Filter items using a query in Falcon Query Language (FQL). Wildcards * are unsupported.   Common filter options include:  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;created_timestamp:&gt;&#39;2019-11-25T22:36:12Z&#39;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;updated_timestamp:&gt;&#39;2019-11-25T22:36:12Z&#39;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;aid:&#39;8e7656b27d8c49a34a1af416424d6231&#39;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :after A pagination token used with the &#x60;limit&#x60; parameter to manage pagination of results. On your first request, don&#39;t provide an &#x60;after&#x60; token. On subsequent requests, provide the &#x60;after&#x60; token from the previous response to continue from that place in the results.
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit The number of items to return in this response (default: 100, max: 5000). Use with the after parameter to manage pagination of results.
  # @option opts [String] :sort Sort assessment by their properties. Common sort options include:  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;created_timestamp|desc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;updated_timestamp|asc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
