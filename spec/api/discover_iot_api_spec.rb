  # unit tests for query_iot_hosts
  # Search for IoT assets in your environment by providing an FQL (Falcon Query Language) filter and paging details. Returns a set of asset IDs which match the filter criteria.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :offset An offset used with the &#x60;limit&#x60; parameter to manage pagination of results. On your first request, donâ€™t provide an &#x60;offset&#x60;. On subsequent requests, add previous &#x60;offset&#x60; with the previous &#x60;limit&#x60; to continue from that place in the results.
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit The number of asset IDs to return in this response (min: 1, max: 100, default: 100). Use with the &#x60;offset&#x60; parameter to manage pagination of results.
  # @option opts [String] :sort Sort assets by their properties. A single sort field is allowed. Common sort options include:  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;hostname|asc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;product_type_desc|desc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
